How do we get React App! to work with Express/ Node API or with MongoDB.


-- When a user navigates to our domain -> we sent back files with HTML (React side of our application)
   This needs data to show what we want to show (ie, Surveys or Campaigns)
   
-- MOngoDb will record and store all the surveys and emails we send out over time

Goal: to communicate effectively between our MongoDB and React application. Though they will not communicate directly.

-- Express API will contain logic to take incoming requesets from React and pull information from MongoDB and then send it back to React application.
--

-- Express API and React application will comminicate through HTTP Requests (containing JSON)
