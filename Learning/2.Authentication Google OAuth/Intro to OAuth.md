# Intro to Google OAuth

1. User signs up via Google OAuth
* Most challenging feature to develop.
2.  User pays for email credits via stripe
3. User creates a new 'campaign'
4. User enters list of emails to send to survey
5. We send email to list of surveyees
6. Surveyees click on link in email to provide feedback
7. We tabulate feedback
8. Users can see report of all the survey responses



## OAuth Workflow
**What is OAuth?**
We essentially just want to have a "Sign in with Google" button which only requires a google account to sign in/sign up.
